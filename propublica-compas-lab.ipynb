    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, a *ProPublica* investigative journalism team including published \"Machine Bias,\" an incisive look at the COMPAS risk prediction system used in the criminal justice system. In addition to the main story that emphasizes the human toll of a racially-biased system, the *ProPublica* team published a detailed methodology, data, and technical documentation for the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is based on that work.\n",

    "18. \"`dplyr` is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:\n",
    "  * `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables\n",
    "  * `select()` picks variables based on their names.\n",
    "  * `filter()` picks cases based on their values.\n",
    "  * `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.\n",
    "  * `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation “by group”. You can learn more about them in [`vignette(\"dplyr\")`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html). As well as these single-table verbs, dplyr also provides a variety of two-table verbs, which you can learn about in [`vignette(\"two-table\")`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html).” [Source: [dplyr.tidyverse.org](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)]\n",

    "22. “R has several systems for making graphs, but `ggplot2` is one of the most elegant and most versatile. ggplot2 implements the grammar of graphics, a coherent system for describing and building graphs. With ggplot2, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.” [[Chapter 3 “Data Visualization”](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) in Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, *R for Data Science*]\n",
    "\n",
    "23. “`ggplot2` is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details...It’s hard to succinctly describe how ggplot2 works because it embodies a deep philosophy of visualisation. However, in most cases you start with ggplot(), supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with aes()). You then add on layers (like geom_point() or geom_histogram()), scales (like scale_colour_brewer()), faceting specifications (like facet_wrap()) and coordinate systems (like coord_flip()).” [[ggplot2.tidyverse.org](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)]\n",

    "66. To test whether Compas scores do an accurate job of deciding whether an offender is Low, Medium or High risk,  *ProPublica* ran a Cox Proportional Hazards model. \n",
    "\n",
    "67. Northpointe, the company that created COMPAS and markets it to Law Enforcement, also ran a Cox model in their [validation study](http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/36/1/21.abstract).\n",
    "\n",
    "68. *ProPublica* used the counting model and removed people when they were incarcerated. \n",

    "69. Due to errors in the underlying jail data, they ended up filtering out 32 rows that have an end date more than the start date. \n",

    "71. What is a Cox Proportional Hazards model?\n",
    "\n",
    "72. \"**Survival analysis** is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one or more events happen, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. This topic is called reliability theory or reliability analysis in engineering, duration analysis or duration modelling in economics, and event history analysis in sociology. Survival analysis attempts to answer certain questions, such as what is the proportion of a population which will survive past a certain time? Of those that survive, at what rate will they die or fail? Can multiple causes of death or failure be taken into account? How do particular circumstances or characteristics increase or decrease the probability of survival?\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis))\n",
    "\n",
    "73. \"**Proportional hazards models** are a class of survival models in statistics. Survival models relate the time that passes, before some event occurs, to one or more covariates that may be associated with that quantity of time. In a proportional hazards model, the unique effect of a unit increase in a covariate is multiplicative with respect to the hazard rate. For example, taking a drug may halve one's hazard rate for a stroke occurring, or, changing the material from which a manufactured component is constructed may double its hazard rate for failure\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model)).\n",
    "\n",
    "74. The Cox Proportional Hazards model was developed by British statistician Sir David Cox in the 1970s. \n",

    "\n",
    "75. The model is as regression model most often used to determine the association or relationship between patient survival time and predictor variables.\n",
