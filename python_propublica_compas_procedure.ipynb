        "“R has several systems for making graphs, but `ggplot2` is one of the most elegant and most versatile. ggplot2 implements the grammar of graphics, a coherent system for describing and building graphs. With ggplot2, you can do more faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.” [[Chapter 3 “Data Visualization”](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) in Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, *R for Data Science*]\n",

        "“`ggplot2` is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details...It’s hard to succinctly describe how ggplot2 works because it embodies a deep philosophy of visualisation. However, in most cases you start with ggplot(), supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with aes()). You then add on layers (like geom_point() or geom_histogram()), scales (like scale_colour_brewer()), faceting specifications (like facet_wrap()) and coordinate systems (like coord_flip()).” [[ggplot2.tidyverse.org](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)]\n",

        "What is a Cox Proportional Hazards model?\n",
        "- \"**Survival analysis** is a branch of statistics for analyzing the expected duration of time until one or more events happen, such as death in biological organisms and failure in mechanical systems. This topic is called reliability theory or reliability analysis in engineering, duration analysis or duration modelling in economics, and event history analysis in sociology. Survival analysis attempts to answer certain questions, such as what is the proportion of a population which will survive past a certain time? Of those that survive, at what rate will they die or fail? Can multiple causes of death or failure be taken into account? How do particular circumstances or characteristics increase or decrease the probability of survival?\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis))\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"**Proportional hazards models** are a class of survival models in statistics. Survival models relate the time that passes, before some event occurs, to one or more covariates that may be associated with that quantity of time. In a proportional hazards model, the unique effect of a unit increase in a covariate is multiplicative with respect to the hazard rate. For example, taking a drug may halve one's hazard rate for a stroke occurring, or, changing the material from which a manufactured component is constructed may double its hazard rate for failure\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model)).\n",
